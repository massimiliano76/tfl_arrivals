This application is not intended for any kind of actual use, at least not yet.
It is a learning exercise, where I experiment with technologies used in Python web applications
such as Flask, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and others.

If you'd like to use any part of it, you're welcome to do so.
Just be careful, some parts of the code are probably still rubbish.
